\section{TODO: Curve Sketching}
\label{sec:CurveSketching}
Geogebra\footnote{\url{http://www.geogebra.org/}} is a fantastic graphing
utility recommended by Chris Gordon for plotting functions. It comes highly with
my recommendation too! Most of the graphs you see in this book have been created
with some sort of help from Geogebra.

It allows you to grab a graph, and wrangle it with your mouse, seeing how
the equation changes in real time, as well as changing the equation and seeing
how the graph changes.

It's free.
It's written in Java.
It works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux\footnote{It installed on my Ubuntu laptop
and with zero tweaking.} and even inside of a browser (though, it takes
forever to fire up).
