If the function has a negative slope, then $f'(x) < 0$.
If the function has a positive slope, then $f'(x) > 0$.
If the function has a slope of $0$, then $f'(x) = 0$.\footnote{However it is
only instantaneously flat. If you think about it, 0 is slightly bigger than
-0.00001 and slightly smaller than 0.00001 (and you can find arbitrarily
smaller numbers that zero fits between)}
\begin{align}
  f \downarrow \Leftrightarrow f' < 0 \\
  f \uparrow \Leftrightarrow f' > 0 \\
\end{align}

Suppose we were to take the derivative of a derivative. This is called the
\emph{second derivative} and can be written as:
\begin{align}
              f''(x) & = \ldots \nonumber \\
  \frac{d^2 f}{dx^2} & = \ldots \nonumber
\end{align}
